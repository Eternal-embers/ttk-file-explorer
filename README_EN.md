## Why this project is useful
* **Specificity**: `tkinter` is easy to use and can meet the basic GUI requirements. However, it also has some limitations and flaws that result in very few developers using it.
* **For Windows**: As a Windows software, it makes full use of the features of the Windows system and provides an experience that is tightly integrated with the operating system.
* **Open source and free**: As an open source project, users can expand and customize according to their own needs, improving the flexibility and convenience of file management.
