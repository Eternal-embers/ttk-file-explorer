## Why this project is useful

* Specificity: `tkinter` is easy to use and can meet the basic GUI requirements. However, it also has some limitations and flaws that result in very few developers using it.

* For Windows: As a Windows software, it makes full use of the features of the Windows system and provides an experience that is tightly integrated with the operating system.

* Open source and free: As an open source project, users can expand and customize according to their own needs, improving the flexibility and convenience of file management.
